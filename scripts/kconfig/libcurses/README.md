PDCurses for Windows console
============================

This directory contains PDCurses source code files specific to the
Microsoft Windows console. Although historically called "Win32", this
port can just as easily be built for 64-bit systems. Windows 95 through
Windows 10 are covered. (Some features require later versions.)
